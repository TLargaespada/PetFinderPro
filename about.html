        <p class="text-normal mt-3">PetFinderPro is a web application that allows users to report lost and found pets in their neighborhoods. It also has a growing database of veterinarian clinics and their contact info so people can call to verify if their pet has been brought in.</p>

        <p class="text-base mt-3">In the future we will implement a feature to search/post pets available for adoption by individuals in their area. 
        <br> Users can view detailed information about each pet, including photos, descriptions, and contact information.</p>
        <p class="text-base">Our mission is to help people and pets reunite and find loving forever homes.</p>
        <p class="text-base mt-3">Thank you for using PetFinderPro!</p>
